Hello! If you want to add your image to your fic author's note, feel free to source it from here!

For those who don't know, this is the code to put in
```<img src="[the image link]" alt="[name of image]" width="[]" height="[]" /> ```

Remove the brackets when you fill in the info but leave the quotation marks. Don't forget to name your image. The alt text is what shows up if the image does not.
